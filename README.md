# README

This Rails5.0API instantiates each new spotify user and stores the data recieved from the Spotify API. 
This API is designed to work in tandem with the Spotify React-App which can be found here. 
In order to populate the database both the Rails5.0 API and the React-App need to be running. 


# Getting Started

To get the API running simply run ```rails s -p5050```

However beforhand you will need your own Spotify ```client_id``` and ```client_secret``` in order to use this app and utilize the repository.
Once you recieve the id and secret from spotify you will need to add these to an application.yml file.
The application.yml file can be generated by running the ```figaro``` gem.  
Also in the application.yml, you will need to create the appropriate designated routes for the variables ```SPOT_REDIRECT``` and ```SPOT_CALLBACK``` as these variables are utilized to store the callback routes in the adapters.rb and sessions_controller.rb.

# README
A React app to enable users to login via Spotify and renders their spotify data in interactive visuals 
created to better understand React/Redux and oauth flow. This app relies on a Rails5 API.  

## Getting Started 
1. You will want to clone down the Rails5 API that is required for this react app and get that running before starting the React app. You can get the Rails5 API and its instructions here. 

2. Once you have the rails side running, clone this repo and run ``` npm install ```

3. Run ``` npm start ``` and this should open the broswer with the app. 

Other Concerns: 
- make sure that the Rails server is not running on the same port as the react app
- If you are already logged in with Spotify it will not take you to the spotify login page and instead immediately redirect
